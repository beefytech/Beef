 *** These are #defines that autoheader puts in config.h.in that we
 *** want to show up in sparseconfig.h, the minimal config.h file
 *** #included by all our .h files.  The reason we don't take
 *** everything that autoheader emits is that we have to include a
 *** config.h in installed header files, and we want to minimize the
 *** number of #defines we make so as to not pollute the namespace.
